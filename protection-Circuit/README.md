# Protection circuit board
I designed this PCB as a part of an exercise in my university technical team 

this board realies on an eFuse (TPS26630) to protect UAV components from:
- Reverse Polarity
- Over-current / short-circuit protection
- Inrush current (hot-plug)
- Over-voltage and under-voltage lockout
- Transient suppression (ESD/inductive kick)

The board is purposly stretched out because I needed to present each component and its use
